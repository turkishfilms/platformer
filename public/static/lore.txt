this is where the lore goes
.


Heng
Player is a burger
The player is trapped and trying to escape the dimensions. And monsters are trying to attack him
 and trying to get rid of him since the monsters want to eat the player. 
 Level should be 8
 monsters spawn on level 2 
End screen it says the player will go back home 
 Level difficulty can be medium or hard
 Hard is more monsters and tiny blocks and the monsters will have more health so more jumps needed
 Also hard mode you have 2 bars of health instead of 3 
 and medium is regular monsters and blocks are normal size
Powerup could be low gravity or speed or health
Powerups spawn in when you are in low health or needed for levels 
For the health powerup if u are low and kill a monsters a food item will 
spawn in the place where you killed the monsters
Health powerups will not spawn always 35 percent chance
