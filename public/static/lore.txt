POTENTIAL STORY IDEAS:
motivation for-
Player,

Maybe competitive, time trials, local/online multiplayer.
Mario style boss, jump on top of it to damage he causes damage ( minus 1 life) on contact.
We want to go to the portal to get back to our home dimension
We accidentally fell into a portal
Exploring the backrooms and took a wrong turn.
Collect all the machine (rocket) parts to win the game.
The portal only lets one person through, and so we are racing other people (aliens) that are also trying to get home.
trying to get home fast, not so puzzling.
quest for balance ??
obstacle,

Basic white blocks. No reason for them to exist, no explantation.
Meteors, space debris
void blocks, fragile or pressure sensitive blocks,
Other world terrain, dinosaur level, dinosaurs. Under the sea, shark, seashells, wrecked pirate ship.
enemies

The boss is stopping us from reaching the portal, because we owe him money
The enemies are upet because the player disturbed their environment, ecosystem
The enemies are mad or arent even bad guys, they just happen to be poisonous.
npc

Some npcs give you buffs in the game. (buffs like: temporary flying, extra jump, speed buffs, shield buff, invisibility buff(hides from enemies), retry)
You pay them in skulls of the enemies. (enemies drop skulls when killed)
These Merchants dislike the enemies and so will grant a random buff upon receiving x amount of skulls.
Logical reasons for some buffs, parachute, better shoes
the skulls have in them the power the enemy had, and these power types grant certain powered buffs, (invisibilty, extra jump) potion/magic based
